# Rhythm_Nest
A Next.js full-stack web application to catalogue your music collection!

## Why use Rhythm Nest?
Imagine you have a large physical music collection consisting of hundreds of vinyl records, CDs and cassette tapes. You have found a record at a store, but are not sure if you own it already.
Typically, you would be required to search through your collection, with may be a difficult task since it is so large.
However! Rhythm nest provides a solution by allowing you to catalogue your music collection digitally, making it easy to track items in your collection.
Additionally, you can add items to a wishlist that you wish to purchase in the future.

## The Technologies
Next.js
- Next.js is a web development framework built off of React, which provides all of the features provided by React, alongside server-side rendering.
TypeScript
- TypeScript is an extension of JavaScript, a popular web development language, which adds features from static typed languages such as Java. This relieves many of JavaScripts issues with type conflicts, by ensuring variables always have the expected type.
